      "message": "Can you comment this change in the description? My understanding is that you are trying to skip defining an \"sys_mmap2\" function for architectures that don\u0027t support it, but it\u0027s not mentioned in the description.\n\nIn particular, is e2k\u0027s behavior supposed to be changing? I don\u0027t know the e2k architecture, but either it has __NP_mmap2 defined (in which case we\u0027ve changed from doing a direct _syscall6 to implement mmap to implementing mmap in terms of mmap2) or it doesn\u0027t have __NP_mmap2 defined (in which case there\u0027s no longer a sys_mmap2)",
